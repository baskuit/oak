Need to actually check the prob code since we are no longer assuming just 20 teams any more. But we will also assume no metronome and other bullshit no one cares about.

I think confusion is still broken for instance.

Lets also private pkmn-pinyon-test  to hide those teams lol.
Really doesn't matter but not using team dump and testing non OU stuff both call for team generation code. Idk what.. team, move names
Fuck it, wrapsire
